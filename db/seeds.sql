('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"Had a lovely brunch here with my sisters this past weekend. Definitely a must visit in NYC for some excellent food and drinks! There was about a 30 minute wait, but we were able to grab a few drinks at the bar before our table was ready. The bartender was great and there are plenty of awesome cocktails to choose from. I will say the Bloody Mary has a very smoky flavor which I didn''t prefer, but overall the cocktails were tasty and well made. My favorite was the Jam Jar! 

Onto the delicious food. We ordered the biscuits and fixins, mac and cheese, chicken biscuit with sausage gravy, and side of fries. I loved the moist, buttery biscuits and the whipped salted butter and maple butter that came with them were soooo good. The mac and cheese was everything I wanted it to be... extra, extra cheesy! Comfort food at its best. Carbs on carbs, but every calorie was worth it. We had a fantastic meal and left full and satisfied. "'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'I don''t give many 5-star reviews but this place is totally worth it. You have to try the signature sausage gravy and chicken biscuits. It doesn''t look the most visually pleasing but man, I''ve never had anything better. Best sausage gravy I''ve had any where (and I try this everywhere I go). Also the chicken and pancakes are incredible too!!! You just can''t go wrong here'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"The portion size was huge! My husband and I ordered the pancakes and chicken plus a side of eggs and a side of biscuits. It was definitely more than enough food for us.

- The fried chicken is off the hook. Lightly battered, fried to perfection and still moist. Sooo good!
- Pancakes were kinda meh since it was a bit dry and normally I''m crazy about pancakes.
- The eggs, nothing special but that''s not why people come here.
- Biscuits were also off the hook.

The vibe on a weekend for brunch is solid. There''s a bit of a wait but the bar is first come, first serve."'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"Amazing. 

Service is on point and so are all the foods on the menu I''ve tried so far. One of my favorite spots in the city. 

Plus, they''re open past midnight! My go-to place to satisfy my late night dinners.

My favorite is the chicken and biscuit in mushrooms sauce. Portions are huge that I always take the leftovers for the next day lunch.

I''ve been a regular for over a year, and excites me to go back every time."'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"When I dream of Southern food, this is the dream I dream.

First of all, the decor here is super cute. It''s the perfect blend of wood and modern. There was a minor snafu with construction causing a piece of the ceiling to come down next to me, but they quickly moved anyone that could be impacted. I''ll look past this - it isn''t in their control, after all.

As for the food, I ordered the buffalo chicken Mac and cheese without the bleu cheese drizzle. I also ordered the biscuits and jam to start. The biscuit was good - not incredible. The jam really made the biscuit. I wish the biscuit had been a tiny bit fluffier.

The Mac and cheese was amazing. This was seriously the best I''ve ever had. I''ve never had a cheesier, more rich Mac. The Mac wasn''t dry at all. The blend of cheeses was spot on. The buffalo chicken added just a tickle of spice, which broke up all the fat. I could eat this Mac endlessly.

The service was great! I came to catch up with a friend, and the server was attentive but not pushy.

I would absolutely recommend this spot. Run, don''t walk."'),

('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'Not surprised by the popularity of this place! I went for the classic Honey Chicken and Pickles and oh it was amazing. The chicken and the special pickles matched so well together! I was most impressed by the sides - the biscuit that was incredibly great and melted in your mouth & the cheese grits, which I fell in love with. Despite the constant business of the place, the service was super quick and our server was so helpful and attentive. I recommend coming with small groups for less wait time but the place is big enough to accommodate larger groups. Highly recommend and can''t wait to try other options on the menu!'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'Came here around 6pm on a Saturday night and it was already at 45 minute wait for 4! Oh boy was the wait worth it though (just don''t come here hungry - you''re almost aways bound to wait for a table). I got the chicken and pancakes and my group got the fried pickles and mac and cheese to share. EVERYTHING was amazing. The chicken was juicy and crispy and complimented the pancakes nicely. The fried pickles were good as well but nothing to write home about (the sauce was addicting though). The mac and cheese is a MUST get. The portions here are huge and I highly recommend the mac and cheese and the chicken & pancakes. Cant wait to come back here - although not too ecstatic about the wait.'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'Jacobs Pickles is definitely one of the best southern comfort food places I''ve been to in NYC! The food was amazing, and so were the cocktails my friend and I order. The only reason this review is getting 4 stars and not 5, is because my dish was cold, but otherwise the service was on point, and the food and drinks were delicious. 

I recommend trying the honey fried chicken sandwich! It was delicious, just wish it was still warm. 

Overall, I had a great experience and will go back and try some of their other delicious dishes.'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"Love this place!  The wait time was crazy both times that I have been (one was 1 hour & 15 mins -- but the actual wait time was 1 hour) - so be prepared to wait...

First time coming here I had the bacon egg & cheese on a biscuit - was good but would be fine without the pile of unmelted cheese on top.  My mom had the buffalo Mac & cheese which was good.

Second visit me & my boyfriend had the street corn which was very tasty.  We also shared (since the portions are large) the chicken & biscuit w/ sausage gravy and cheese grits come w/ it.  The grits were not a favorite to me (although my boyfriend like them); chicken was ok, not much seasoning to it - but the gravy was the best I ever had!"'),

('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"I came here early for breakfast the day after Thanksgiving when my parents were visiting and luckily there was no wait that early, but by the time we left the place was packed. Everything was awesome. My asian mom who usually doesn''t like unhealthy American food absolutely loved the spicy okra and told me she loved it so much she recreated it at home. 

We definitely needed to take a walk in the park after eating here but the calories are so worth it."'),

('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"Overall: You want comfort? Come here, loosen the belt, and enjoy some Southern goodness that''s up there with the best!

The good: The biscuits app and pancakes in my chicken and pancakes (not waffles) were the best I''ve had in a long time, maybe ever. Fluffy, dense, and flavorful. Paired with the fried chicken (and bacon), I left with half my meal and rolled out of the place. It''s rare when I don''t finish my plate. The ambiance is fantastic, with low lighting, incredible music, and overall good vibes. Plus, plenty of good drinks and a vast Southern menu to choose from.

The not-so-good: Not a ton of space, so it''s cramped and crowded. We also had to wait for our table for a long time even though we had reservations, but they comped us with some free apps."'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"Finally getting to try this place after living in the UWS for 2 years. Each time we went on the weekend we were face with a long wait, so we never made it in.  Now that I''m on maternity leave, we made it in on a Thursday - no wait time! The staff were great and helpfully accommodated my baby and stroller. 

Food wise - we ordered the special pickles, fried pickles, and devilled eggs as starters. Delicious but a bit pricey.

As a main - I ordered the Croque Monsieur. Delicious. My favourite part was the cheese, the tastiest cheesy melt I''ve had the pleasure of having in a very long time."'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'Great stop in for a late lunch at Jacobs.  Great cool casual ambience.  We grabbed 2 open spots at the bar and were greeted cheerily by the bartender.  Nice selection of craft beers and cocktails.  A treat to find DuClaws Sweet Baby Jesus Porter on draft so I stopped looking once I saw that on the menu. Bloody BLT for Kat which is a Tito''s bloody Mary with bacon and a deviled egg.  A work of art which tastes as good as it looks.  Let the gluttony begin..... Overall a great meal with great drinks and great service.  To say we left stuffed would be an understatement so come hungry.  Plenty of menu options we want to try so we will be back!!!'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'I came to New York City for a work trip and decided to add a few days on for sightseeing. Of all the things I went to, this place was by far my favorite. The menu of food and beer options were outstanding. I had the honey fried chicken and pancakes for lunch topped with crumbled bacon and I will forever be a changed man! The flavor, the crunch, the sweetness, and presentation were all outstanding. My server was very fun and friendly, especially knowing that I was from out of town and had no clue what I was looking at or trying to order. The place had a very rustic meets modern vibe and even the coffee with fresh cream was so savory and delicious. I am trying to get back there for another go before I leave!'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'Wait time was a bit long, but it''s worth the wait. We got an assortment of pickles, the biscuits, and I ordered a burger with a fried egg and grits. SO good! I particularly loved the sweet sauces they used for the biscuits. Will definitely be returning'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"Killer menu and killer food. Great cocktails too. I rarely get overwhelmed with menus but this is a justified place to feel so. Got the 4 pickled types for $11 (dilly green beans, candy red beets, sweet & spicy carrots, sour green tomatoes), $8 biscuits & fixins, $16 honey chicken & pickles. $12 rosemary vodka lemonade. All f*cking delicious (and great values). Biscuit butters were epic, and the fried chicken was perfect between being a moist cut and ideally battered.

Was packed for 8:30pm on a Tuesday in March. I can only imagine the madness for prime dinner & brunch times.

Waiter was awesome and hospitable. Thanks so much to the Jacob''s Pickles fam."'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'Love this place, never disappoints.ive been here numerous of times and tried different items everytime. Everything I have tried has been delicious. One of my favorite places and I always recommend it to my peers and they are also pleased.'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"I moved to UWS less than a year ago, and ever since all I have heard about was Jacob''s Pickles. My friends told me about it, my family told me about it, even my dentist insisted that I go and experience it for myself. Well, I finally made it here on a cold, snowy Monday evening, and I can confirm that Jacob''s Pickles lives up to the hype.
Walking in, the venue is dimly lit by tabletop candles, so visibility was challenging at times. When seated, we immediately ordered fried pickles and biscuits, both were incredibly delicious! For entrees, we each had a combination of chicken with a side. I ordered the hot chicken biscuit, which ended up being fairly spicy, yet not overwhelming. Portions were generous, and we left the restaurant with plenty of left overs for the next day. For any foodie looking for a bucket list restaurant, this place is for you!
Extra points for the waitress bringing the pay terminal to our table. I was able to add tip, and get an email receipt all from their tablet! Worth every penny."'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'As always, one of my must visit while in NYC. The food is amazing and sooo much of it! Love the biscuits and fixins! You must eat here at least once!'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"To start, my mimosa was excellent: great balance between champagne and fresh pulpy orange juice. The hot toddy is also a worthwhile drink. The biscuits and gravy were very interesting. I couldn''t quite place the flavor of the gravy but it was great. The biscuits were soft, and the sausage in the gravy had a lovely earthy taste with an underlying sweetness.
Despite all of that, I was not impressed with the famous chicken and pancakes. Everything on the plate was dry. The chicken cutlets lacked the juiciness that could have come from a drumstick/thigh. The pancakes were helpless, but the syrup was the worst offender. The container for the syrup had such a slow drip that I couldn''t coat the food in desperately needed moisture the way I wanted to. The waiter eventually took off the cap for easier pouring, but by then I lost interest. This dish didn''t mesh and eating it became a chore. 
Overall not a bad first time. I give these guys credit for the huge portions. However, I think I let the hype skew my expectations. I may give them another shot but I rarely go up this far for brunch.

('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"Seriously can''t find anything wrong with this restaurant.
Heard there is always a wait, so came in with a friend on a Friday morning around 10:45am.
Location is fantastic!
Decor is cute and instagrammable.
Service was attentive. And on a Friday morning, there was NO WAIT. We got seated immediately.
Took my friends recommendation and got the sausage gravy smothered fried chicken on a biscuit. 
Food came out surprisingly quickly. The portions are HUGE. Prices are also reasonable at entrees averaging +/-$15!
Now you can taste and feel that butter and cream ... but you came for comfort food and this place does NOT disappoint! 
Instead of a nap, go for a walk right after... Central Park is right around the corner and you''re just a short stroll from other great day drinking options."'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"You must come to this place whenever you are in the city but if you come for brunch or dinner definitely have the expectation that you will be waiting for a while so snack before or something because if you come starving realize you won''t be eating for at least 40 min depending on how many people. 
My friend and I came here for lunch and then there was no wait so if you want to come in and eat and have the place not be too loud for sure plan on coming for lunch!
I always share when I come here since the portions are huge especially for me! I''m a sucker for French fries so I ordered poutine for our appetizer. This dish is amazing! It''s French fries with cheese and gravy (I''m not a fan of gravy but this combination is AMAZING) we also ordered the chicken BBQ sandwich and again I''m not a fan of BBQ sauce on chicken but I''d figure I''ll give it shot and I''m glad I did. It tasted incredible! The sauce really got me! It was delicious! After we came out food came pretty quickly and our waiter was amazing ! So attentive and kept refilling my water! Which is always a good sign for me!"'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"The first time we tried to come here, we naively thought we could get seated immediately walking in at 7pm on a sunday night. Ha. Ha. Ha. It was a 45 minute wait. We were starving so we left and went to a nearby Italian restaurant. At that Italian restaurant, the table next to us said loudly, ""man, we never get into Jacob''s Pickles"" and ""omg that meal at Jacob''s Pickles was the best meal of my life."" My friends and I looked at each other and we wondered if Jacob''s Pickles was like the exclusive club you could not get into. 
The next time we went, we were expecting to wait but got seated immediately as a party of two. Score. The restaurant on the inside is very dark. All you will see is a small candle in front of you, flickering ever so gently. You will barely be able to read the menu with the amount of light they give. We ordered the fried pickles (which were 10/10), macaroni and cheese, and biscuits and fried chicken. Everything was amazing. Everything was the best meal ever. "'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"For the long wait and all the people raving about Jacobs Pickles, I was left slightly unimpressed after my first visit. We were told 45 minute wait but waited a little over an hour and had to continuously harass the hostess until we were seated as we watched numerous other 3 person parties be seated.  
The spacing there is also tight, both for waiting and in the actual seating in the back. There''s a few long communal tables in the back but thankfully we were seated at a side table so we didn''t have to share elbow space with strangers.  I had an Arnold Palmer to start and it was delicious and the lemonade tasted freshly squeezed. I had the bacon egg and cheese biscuit and it was overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time. Definitely a huge potion of food and you def can''t eat this like a regular biscuit sandwich because of size. So I found myself using a fork to eat some biscuit bacon and eggs together. The biscuit was thick and delicious. The bacon was also to die for, super crispy. The eggs were just eh. And all together, it just didn''t hit the spot the way I expected. However, for the biscuit and lemonade alone, I''d go back and give it another try."'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'I''ve come here multiple times and sometimes I forget to check in. But this time I''m very excited because it''s my first time coming in for breakfast on a Sunday. I even Arrived 10 minutes before opening time, and I''m glad I did because this place quickly gets packed. Especially during brunch. I ordered the Jacob''s Pickles and omg its so good with the spicy mayo sauce ($10) i then ordered the chicken bacon egg and cheese biscuit ($17) I must say it was really good and great portion. I really love this'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"My fiancé surprised me for my birthday by taking me here and I must say it was amazing. The wait was a bit but it''s nyc it''s expected. The ambiance was remarkable and the staff was very knowledgeable. 
Food: I ordered the catfish tacos which were the bomb dot com. Just imagine 3 tacos filled with authentic flavor and pickled vegetables that were surprisingly good. 
The meat balls were cooked to perfection and put you into a chili mindset with all of the rich flavors. 
The elotes were not to impressive but good enough to eat. 
The spicy chicken sandwich with grits were a touch of heaven, the chicken was so tender and well seasoned and the kick wasn''t to over powerful. 
I almost forgot the Mac and cheese aka the best in NYC"'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'The food there is really good, the southern with NYC vibe. It''s pretty long wait after 12:30 so try to go early. Also the fresh OJ is too small so just get the water there. However they made it fresh for both OJ and Lemonade so if you don''t mind the price, it''s really good.'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"Jacob''s Pickles is fatty and delicious. My bf used to live around the corner from this restaurant and it was totally a guilty pleasure of ours (didn''t help that his next apartment was across the street from L''Artusi...).
We generally stuck to the biscuit sandwiches which you really can''t go wrong with. I most often had the egg & cheese and LOVED it. Really decadent, very flavorful, filling and delicious. 
We also had a hilarious late-night evening here once - it gets kinda sceney post 11p! If memory serves correctly, we had picklebacks, made new friends with whom we shared said picklebacks, and were pleasantly surprised by what a great evening we had at a place we typically associated only with delicious brunch. 
Big fan of this place and have been meaning to come back for some time - will hopefully make it soon!"'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'We''ve been going here for a very long time and it has never disappointed. The food is always incredible, the drinks are strong and delicious. The staff is without fail kind and considerate. It can be a bit of a wait on weekends, but you can always kill time at the bar next door and it''s definitely worth the wait. If you''re helped by Dani, you''re in luck. She is incredibly down-to-earth, conscientious, and an all-around great person to be around. This is by far one of the best places in the city to have a celebratory or simply joyous dinner, drink, and experience.'),
('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', 'Jacob pickles you just make me so happy! From bunch and dinner you never disappoint. The beer is ultimately why I love this place so much but the food is just the topping to the icing. Chicken and waffle is to die for and the grits omg the grits! I never liked the grits before but Jocob has definitely shown it love and I am now a grits lover. I visited just recently for Mother''s Day and it was delightful. Definitely a place I will recommend to all my friends!!'),

('xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg', '"I ordered the fried chicken with sausage gravy and biscuits, with a side of hot and sour pickles. Let me tell you guys, these biscuits are probably the best thing I''ve eaten in a really long time! They are so fluffy and light and have a beautiful buttery taste that melts in your mouth. Top that with the sausage gravy, and you''re in heaven! The gravy is filled with rich flavor, coupled with the crispiness of the fried chicken. Absolute perfection! 

The sweet and sour pickles are dynamite! It has a lovely tanginess from the vinegar complemented with heat from the chiles.

There''s really not much you can''t love about Jacob''s Pickles! Definitely one of my top southern restaurants in the city!"'),

Once you''re seated they don''t rush you even if it''s busy. The only reason I took off a star is that they haven''t quite figured out how to seat people quickly when it''s busy. There were multiple empty seats and there were plenty of people who could have sat there. They seem to want to get your information because they may have some kind of computerized check-in system. I''m assuming that''s the reason for the delay. You can see a person I''m assuming is a manager walking around with a tablet collecting information.'),

Last night was my first time here and I will definitely be back! They told us the wait was 30 minutes if we wanted to sit outside but 10-15 minutes later we were called for our table (yay!). We obviously ordered a ton of the pickles- all sooooo good. The only one I didn''t absolutely love was the carrot -but they were my boyfriends favorite so I guess it just depends how much you like carrots. For dinner I had the bbq chicken- and my boyfriend had the bacon egg and cheese. Both were incredible and I surprisingly didn''t walk away feeling like I had a weight sitting in my stomach, which was nice."'),

Mostly southern style foods with a modern flair. I''ve had several of their chicken sandwiches as well as the biscuits and gravy and loved both. BBQ smothered pepper jack chicken was probably my favorite. Grits as a side are a must.
The cocktails are the other part of what makes this great. The jam jar and Kentucky porch supper both rocked my world. Beer selection is decent as well. Well rounded. Solid brews from all over the country.
The pickles speak for themseRestaurant offered big portion, it is better to share. We ordered too much, from the appetizer, drink, entree... end up lots of leftover. Wish anyone there would remind us the portion.lves. Top notch. For sure give this place a try."'),

Ordered the meatballs appetizer, honey chicken sandwich, and the meatloaf. Food takes forever to arrive, which is the reason I took away a star. It''s damn near torture! Well, the meatballs appetizer was great. Comes in a skillet with tomato sauce and cheese. The entrees were delicious. I highly recommend both! If you want a sweet dish, get the honey chicken. Comes with grits and super soft biscuits. The menu is interesting as it combines Jewish food with southern, and does it so well. JP''s is one of my new favorite restaurants in the city."'),

We were a party of four on a Saturday morning for brunch. The wait wasn''t excruciating. We were seated in the middle of a long table which is efficient for seating in small restaurants but not my favorite. I''ll echo the comments of others that its super tight. Luckily I didn''t end up next to a left-headed patron otherwise we would have DEFINITELY been bumping elbows the entire time (we already were a fair bit).
We were, obviously, in the mood for biscuits.. all the biscuits. The croque madame was impeccable and super filling; certainly repeat worthy. The biscuit french toast I had a difficult time fully understanding.. it wasn''t sweet enough either. Overall, I''d say there weren''t many sweet biscuit options which was a dissapointment."'),

But if you''re ordering a main dish with eggs, I''d be careful

The Croque Madame came out on a hot pan, all the flavors melted in my mouth, the cheese, biscuits, eggs and hams all in one.
The pancakes with crumbled bacon bites on it was also a winner. The syrup was dark and didn''t taste like the generic store bought one. 
The employees and manager was really friendly. Madina came to check on us right after we ordered food. So we couldn''t say how the food was yet. She chatted with us for a bit and she even gave us a ice cream bread pudding on the house! Her name is Madina. I will definitely come back here again."'),

The waiter had great suggestions and the lemonade tasted fresh. The Buffalo Mac and Cheese was a great mix of different cheeses, a classic blu cheese and chicken that crunched when bit like it was just taken off the stove. The Honey chicken with pickles had a side of grits and cornbread below. If you got a bite with each item from that plate, the flavors of sweet, sour and a bit of spice mixed incredibly well.

It is super crowded here and there is usually a pretty long wait for brunch on the weekends. You can stand in the bar area and wait, or you can walk around the neighbourhood and they will text you when your table is ready. 
I especially love this place because they have vegetarian biscuits and gravy, a dish that traditionally has sausage in it. You can order the gravy as mushroom gravy instead of sausage gravy in order to make it vegetarian. The biscuits are fluffy and the gravy is rich and delicious. 
The cheese grits is loaded with cheese, as is the mac and cheese. There  are a bunch of even heavier dishes in the menu if that''s what you are looking for.
Jacob''s Pickles is a great brunch spot with Southern style foods and good vegetarian options. It is definitely worth the wait for weekend brunch here."'),

The pancakes were very thick and heavy and the fried chicken breast was delicious and conveniently boneless. The only mild complaint was all the bacon bits made the whole dish very rich and sweet which made it impossible to finish with how generous the portion was. When the syrup was added to the pancake, the sweetness with the bacon became a bit overpowering. However, I may be more sensitive to that level of sweetness than others. If you love sweet breakfasts, this is definitely the dish and restaurant for you. Over all my guest and I had a very nice lunch.

My date and I got this berry alcohol drink (okay that''s not what it''s called but I don''t remember names)! Be wary- it tastes super fruity and you question if you are truly drinking alcohol but trust me when you''re done, you know you were :). 
We got the fried pickles to start. They were really good and the spicy mayo was a nice compliment. I only wish that the outer skin was a bit crispier but I get that that''s hard to do as, well, you''re dealing with pickles here. They''re kind of naturally wet...(disregard that that came out wrong).
Next came to the poutine...Jesus Christ it was huge. Like HUGE. I can see it easily feeding a family of six. Of course in my mind this isn''t a bad thing at all because who doesn''t like a mountain of fries with gravy and cheese but if you''re looking for a simple app to share between two people, pass between this.

Everyone greeted you that worked here regardless if they were your server or not. Policy for working there? Possibly. It was cool and welcoming. The atmosphere is dark and lit very dimly via lights and candlelights, but was loud from the background music and clamor within.

The food did not disappoint. I ordered the Hot Chicken Sandwich with a Left Hand Milk Stout. This might be the only spicy meal they got, or the only one I was able to see in the dimly lit room, but the spiciness is no joke. I was sweating from it being unexpectedly kicking me.

I actually asked for a little more gravy to drown my biscuit (and got charged $5)--probably not worth that, but oh well.  Overall it was very flavorful, but I needed to add some spice to kick it up a notch and they gave me some sriracha sauce.

Jacob''s Pickles is located in the Upper West Side only a couple minutes away from the park. We only had to wait about 15-20 minutes, which is basically a NYC Christmas miracle. 

Fair warning: come with an appetite! This southern charmed restaurant does not play about their portion sizes -- come ready to eat! We started off with some mimosas - tangy and honestly, not that strong. I could probably use another dash of champagne or Prosecco in my glass, but it was good regardless. I got the chicken and pancakes (bacon bits on the side). The buttermilk pancakes were fluffy and the chicken was nicely seasoned. It was nice switch up from the overdone chicken and waffles plates many brunch spots do. One of my sisters got the Buffalo Mac n'' Cheese which was above and beyond in flavor. Super cheesy. Super good. 10/10 would get again. My other sister got the Southern BLT which was also super yummy. The grits are on the savory-cheesy side, so if that''s not your thing, maybe opt for a sweeter side.

If you don''t know Jacob''s Pickles is the sister restaurant to Maison''s Pickles located around the corner on Broadway. You can sense the family resemblance once you sit down and enjoy the amazing comfort food options.

Jacob''s has more of a rustic feel and trendy atmosphere. In my opinion I favor Jacob''s menu over Maison''s (chicken & pancakes) but you can''t go wrong with either option.

The savory French toast was a super hearty meal-- I usually just expect for restaurants, by default, to skimp on the nicer ingredients, but the bacon and Swiss were heavily loaded on top and it was incredible.

First off there was no host meaning the wait to sit was ridiculous for no reason. We ended up just ordering at the counter and not having table service. Even once we finally ordered things still went wrong. Three dishes we wanted were unavailable since they didn''t have key ingredients (i.e. Lox) and that was disappointing as the menu isn''t that extensive. When the first dish came out with a hair on the plate that put me over the edge... they did replace the dish, but that always ruins my appetite. The other dishes were good as usual, just again key condiments and ingredients were unavailable, like mustard. 

Maybe will give them another try this fall, but overall not too great for being open for 2+ years now I think. Come on."'),

Anyway, both were amazing. Definitely will return. 
Also got a load of whole wheat bread and a piece of chocolate rugelah from the adjacent bakery on the way out. Both were decent.

We both ordered the French toast, I had the bacon and egg savory French toast and my sister had the berry and cream one. The savory French toast was average.

They will package the treats up, nothing fancy, just in a white box with a Kirsh Bakery sticker but it does the job. They always have some samples out on the counter, which are ridiculously tempting. Never been in here without kids and their parents or guardian or whomever sitting at a table, very family oriented place. Only one kind of coffee, again, it''s decent, not the best cup I''ve had but it does the trick and the to go cups are cute.

While the latte was very standard, the hot chocolate was really good. Had sort of a whipped milk element to add richness and wasn''t overly sweet so I just kept wanting to drink it.

It''s a sort of combination restaurant / cafe / bakery-- very casual, airy, clean and lots of natural light. I had the grapefruit juice ($4) and the bacon, egg, and swiss savoury french toast ($16). The portions are quite sizeable-- their fresh juices come in a 16 oz cup and I had to take part of my meal to go.

Their french toasts are the standout here: the ""restaurant-size"" consists of two dense, inch-thick slices of the bakery''s milk toast, fried to a perfect buttery crisp and absolutely slathered in toppings. The pairing of salty bacon & mild swiss with sweet maple syrup-- perfect. They have sweet and savory options, and you can also request a ""bakery size"", which is cheaper as it is just one piece of toast instead of two. I''ll definitely be back to try their sweet toasts."'),

We ordered the tomato soup that comes with pastry (and then we ordered 2 more of the pastries because they was so good!!). We also had he daily quiche that was an amazing mix of cheeses, served with fresh and lemony salad. Lastly, we had a grill chicken sandwich (which usually a lame, standard thing to order let''s be honest) but no! It was freaking gourmet!!! The flavors and textures just blended so beautifully, I kinda miss that sandwich and it''s only been 1/2 hour.

My only complaint is that they were out of everything during peak hour. I wanted the lox french toast but they were out of lox. They were also out of a few of the cocktails and also specific cheeses, I can''t remember what. Because of this, it made it hard to decide what I wanted since my first choice was out.

On an early Sunday morning, I enjoyed their savory French toast: fluffy perfectly baked bread topped with bacon, eggs, and swiss.

The only thing that was sad was that the food took a while to have our food on the table. We were so hungry! Sometimes the staff were a bit slow, but maybe it was because it was a busy morning.

The breakfast plate it surprisingly filling and comes with 2 eggs scrambled with either bacon, cheese or lox. There''s toast and some pickles. The Swiss cheese twist is similar to the one at Breads bakery but needs to be warmed up. The flavor is less cheesier but still a nice treat. I wouldn''t say the service is overly warm but they have their moments. It''s definitely a good addition to the neighborhood.'),

The burger is spot on (maybe even one of the best I''ve had in a long time). Be sure to order to garlic sauce with your French fries. Oh and the frozen mint lemonade is a definite in the summer. Try to end each meal with some dessert fresh from the bakery. It will not disappoint.

The French Toast was fluffy with a hint of crispiness on the outside and a light sweetness. The French Toast was topped with crispy bacon, melty cheese, and two eggs over easy. The combination of the French Toast, Bacon, and Egg Yolk was perfect and could be the best French Toast I have ever had!

I did not care for the eggplant appetizer as it was too rich for me and not enough eggplant.  It is possible that someone else would love it.  The cucumber salad was tasty and huge. 
The lamb dish was the best I ever had.  The pasta seafood was better the next day when the flavors melded.  The potato bread was so good we bought a loaf to take home.  I just wish there was a curtain between the front room and the back room.  You can see and hear the kids in the front room screaming when you are trying to have a nice dinner in the back room.  I would go back just for the lamb.  PS:  We went back again and, unfortunately, they were out of lamb.  Also, three different wines on the menu were not available.

To top it off, grab a well-mixed wake up cocktail, like the Swimming Pool - an orange, champagne mix delight. The service is maybe a bit slow, but only because of the crowd - we were still in and out in under an hour. A nice addition for your Sunday brunch rotation.'),

('UQGwXsOt9u0uZX0bY6j1kw', 'Yummity, yum, yum!  I came here a few weeks back when they had just opened and the couple of items that I tasted were REALLY good.  Specifically, the croissant was airy, flaky and super fresh and the peanut butter pie was delectable.  Today we had some of the French toast with the cream and homemade jam.  We ordered extra jam on the side and licked the little ramekin clean.  We learned that they make the jam in house--not too sweet, a little tart, great little chunks of fruit.  Just goodness!  The French toast was unique, fluffy and clean and made from their homemade bread.  While the price are full- this is a perfect example of "you get what you pay for".  It all tastes a little bit better when you know its homemade.  I look forward to when the restaurant part is open for brunch... they said its a week or two away. Will go back and update this review with more photos!'),

Coffee arrived without sugar (a 5 minute  wait) food (finally) arrived barely tepid and potatoes were so salty as to be inedible - I balked at sending it back because by now the restaurant was busy and we were late.  I tried to call the manager later to complain when I was told he would be there but the phone goes to voicemail.  This is a local restaurant with a fair amount of competition - it was excellent when I first started eating here so this is a real shame.'),

The food was delicious, fresh, and inviting. We split the soup of the day, a broccoli soup thickened with potato and topped with sourdough croutons and cracked pepper. A lighter version of broccoli soup, but still delicious and filling! My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich and I got the tomato and goat cheese sandwich.

The ambiance was clean and quiet, very nice for dining.

A really wonderful place. We plan on coming back for brunch and to try the cocktails.

Thank you!"'),

Very nice staff and the service was pretty prompt. The French toast was amazing but the omelet could have been better. I ordered a spinach and goat cheese omelet and the goat cheese was found in a big chunk at the end of the omelet - not too appetizing.

('UQGwXsOt9u0uZX0bY6j1kw', '"Just had dinner tonight for the first time. Very flavorful, but very, very salty. Everything. Left with a splitting headache. 
We ordered the shrimp and artichoke appetizer. Again, very tasty--but so salty. And the artichoke was almost inedible because it was not cooked enough to be eaten. The sauce had a wonderful flavor otherwise. Plates this strangely plated dish was served on were too small and the wrong shape. Added to the difficulty of enjoying the food. Artichoke should have been cooked much longer or smaller pieces or hearts. 
Cheeseburger and Trout ""Nicoise"" also super salty. Trout is misnamed. It isn''t a salad. It is a whole fish laid over arugula and green beans with a deviled egg on the side. Heavy. Cheeseburger also had some strange flavoring in the meat itself. Maybe too much pepper?  Almost had to send it back. Asked for medium, it was rock solid through and through. Fries weren''t very good either. Thin, over-cooked. For $16 it should be perfect.  Local diners do a better job by far. 
The chairs are very uncomfortable, too small, mostly not deep enough and they feel flimsy.  My dinner companion, at 6 feet, was not comfortable at all. 
Lastly, the music in the bathroom was blaring at many times the decibels of the rest of the restaurant. 
I so wish the food was better and the seats more comfortable. It is close, but not really there"'),

Sweet option was served with fresh cooked pear on top and a side of cream and pear purée. Unbelievable and not too sweet. 
Never had savory French Toast before but that was also impeccable. The chefs obviously care about the product they''re putting out.
Great new spot. No crazy waits. We were told 25 minutes and received a table in less than 10. If you do have a wait, there''s a bakery and coffee shop they invite you to enjoy and they will come get you.

The super nice waiter told us we could sit anywhere. He also suggested we not order the two continental breakfasts like we were going to.. that it was A LOT of food for 2, which I appreciated! The 1 plate was fine for the 2 of us, plus my mocha and I was full as a tick. The toast with jam was AWESOME. Very cute place!

Well,  I didn''t heed the warning, thought it would be too red if cooked medium rare, so I asked for it medium.  Sure enough it came well done, with no juiciness at all, and smothered in cheese. The taste was terrible as well... could hardly eat it - left most of it on the plate.  The bun was soft and brioche-like, but very salty.  The side salad was also off, too drenched in dressing. My friend fared better with the quiche, which was a large piece.  Everything seemed extremely overpriced ($16 for a crappy cheeseburger?).   Maybe breakfast is better here?  Don''t know,  but doubtful I''d return.  There are too many other places nearby with better quality food that are dependable.  It also breaks my heart that Popover, which once occupied this spot, is no longer around.  They had far better food and better prices.'),

The atmosphere was nice too, good music (I can tell they like Adele), brightly lit space, nice style, and clean. And as I mentioned, staff was really great.

Updated to add: have since gone for lunch and brunch 8 or 9 times and it''s always a pleasure! Wait isn''t too long, the waiter and host recognize me and is very friendly and food is well portioned and speedy. The only so-so thing on the menu I''ve encountered is the ""healthy breakfast"" which is a little small and poorly planned, but lox french toast and daily quiche are favorites, plus lots of others.

The toast was delicious nonetheless (especially in the lox, creme fraiche, spring onion french toast), but in the  sweet toast with mascarpone and berry jam, it was a little dry and unsatisfying. My mother''s omelette was extremely salty and her whole grain toast was also a bit dry and "healthy" tasting.

The salmon eggs benny was good too, although it didn''t come with baked goods that the other egg dishes come with.  Boo.  for 18 dollars, I feel like throwing in a muffin wouldn''t be that hard, would it?

The hostess was friendly and engaging as she lead us to a quiet table.  A I asked for my favorite Lemon and Ricotta pancakes with a side of (gasp!) bacon while my favorite friend asked for Salmon Eggs Benedict. Service was quick  but not rushed and we settled to enjoying our meal.  The hint of lemon gives the pancakes a fresh taste which was perfect for spring. Since we are both believers of sharing our food, my friend gave me some of the salmon benedict  and I restrained myself from stealing his food. 

We skipped the dessert and just opted for cappuccinos which were pitch-perfect.  As we walked out of the restaurant, the line is now longer and we were glad we started our Easter early with Sarabeth''s delicious breakfast."'),

Although I really can''t say anything negative about the meal it wasn''t really anything to write home about.

We had to wait around 15 min to get in. I liked the decor and the arrangement nice cozy and little old style. Started of with the Four Flower Juice which was pretty good and is surely worth a try. My friend got Lemon and Ricotta Pancakes with Fresh Berries. It had a slight tangy taste and my friend loved it. I didn''t it that exciting though. I got the Salmon Eggs Benedict which I surely relished. You can see the picture of it here on its Yelp page, the one with yellow sauce.

But it wasn''t great food. I got the the smoked salmon eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce ($17.50).  The salmon tasted like something I would buy at a gas station vending machine (not that I would buy smoked salmon at a gas station... just saying), and the sauce was watery and metallic tasting.  She got the buttermilk pancakes with fresh strawberries ($16), and they were doughy and heavy. 

It also didn''t help that the four most annoying girls in NY were sitting next to us talking at the top of their lungs and wearing sunglasses indoors (made me think of Larry David, who once said, ""Do you know who wears sunglasses indoors?

Overall, I would say the quality of the brunch here is above average, but not spectacular. It is definitely on the more expensive side, even when compared with other brunch places nearby.

Great brunch place on the UWS. If you get here early on brunch hours 1030 am you may not need to wait too long. Any later expect a hour to hour 1/2 wait. Is it worth it? Yes.

The food is spectacular. From coffee to the pastries and everything in between. Coffee came out hot and freshly roasted with a strong coffee bean taste which i love. Omlettes were light, fluffy, french style. Start off with some home made granola with fresh fruit and berries and milk. Eggs Benedict came out with the perfect poached eggs and a tasty hollandaise sauce. Pastries are a must and the scones and muffins with the pastries basket were great.

Don''t forget the bloody marys or Mimosas. On your way out, you can always pick up a jar of Sarabeth''s preserves. Just right on your pastries at home. A definite brunch time spot which doesn''t fail."'),

I ordered the Farmer''s Omelette, which sounds awesome but it felt more like Farmer''s leftovers thrown in with some unseasoned eggs.  My gf ordered the ""fat and fluffy french toast,"" which may have been fat at one point, but were now just sadly bulimic and were fluffy much in the way that bricks are.

Seriously, this is definitely a solid brunch place, but there is something so offensive about a side order of bacon that''s seven dollars and orange juice (okay, it''s fresh squeezed but still) that''s six. Also, when I was there this past Sunday, the fat and fluffy french toast was super dry. Whatever happened to soaking the bread all the way through with egg so that it really tastes like french toast and not merely like challah bread with a thin coating of egg batter? i didn''t send it back because it was busy and I didn''t want to be obnoxious--maybe that''s their special signature particular french toast style--but I now regret that I didn''t. After all, for a breakfast totaling $35.00 per person (what I paid including tax and tip) everything should be crazy perfect. Also, the whole suburban UWS scene with moms and dads and strollers and the sort of entitled atmosphere feels strangely artificial and kinda bland.

Atmosphere is bright and cheerful. Although it could use a freshening up. We ordered a Lobster Roll, Potato Waffles, Cobb Salad, Burger and French Toast. Everything was well prepared and tasted good. Only negative was that the burger was over cooked. We asked for medium and it came back well. Oh and a new and clumsy waiter spilled ice water on my wife''s back.

Menu is extensive - comprehensive varieties of French toast / pancakes / omelets, and more lunch-y plates as well. I noticed several oatmeal offerings which I thought was unique and a standby option if I was in a Goldilocks sort of mood.

Food was okay - I ordered the Farmer''s Omelet and my friend got the Eggs Benedict. The Farmer''s Omelet comes with a side of muffin / croissant / scone, and they were extremely generous with the gruyere.

I wouldn''t suggest going with more than a partner on the weekend as the wait can get bad for groups of 3 or 4s unless you have 6 and then you can make a reservation.

Then menu is fantastic!  A variety of  unique french toast & waffle options.  From my friend who''s lived in this city his whole life I''m told this is the best brunch in the city and I don''t disagree.

I wait for a seat in the back, you can''t beat those comfy booths.  

Hmm, good...do it!"'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"Pros:  Disclaimer-- As the backdrop for many celebratory brunches over the course of my life, my fondness for Sarabeth''s is likely influenced in no small part by nostalgia. That said, if I were to stumble upon Sarabeth''s as a first-timer, I would fall in love with the french toast, or the pancakes, or the berry-encrusted versions of either one, or the complimentary champagne cocktails. Or the general sensation of being treated to brunch on an Easter Sunday by your grandparents (even if you''re just out with your fellow 20-something friends).

Cons: Even as a non-first-timer, boy do those long lines put me off. Go EARLY! Before noon is best. Also, I will admit that the food is not always worth the pricetag, but consider that you pay for the overall experience, and the free champagne.

Balance: PROS

BOTTOM LINE: Sarabeth''s is a treat. Go when your folks are in town and you''re on their dime, and go when a special occasion calls for it. But if you''re just looking for a spot to grab breakfast, go up the block to EJ''s and stop complaining."'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"Due to scheduling difficulties, my group and I needed to get brunch at a punishingly early Sunday morning hour: 9 AM! Sarabeth''s is open from 8 AM, which came in handy as most places begin their Sundays at 11. I also expected there to not be a wait at such an ungodly hour, yet the four of us were standing around for 15 minutes waiting for a table to open.

Regardless, yes, in my opinion this is the best brunch food in the city. Note that it''s not the best deal nor the least expensive but no matter what you order, you will be thrilled, satisfied and wishing fervently to come back so you can try everything else on the menu. 

We had: lemon ricotta pancakes (me) - light, zesty, not overwhelming; buttermilk pancakes (brother #1) [didn''t try this]; fat and fluffy french toast (brother #2) - true to its name, fluffy and so, so good; and Goldie lox (friend) - frittata-like eggs with lox and cream cheese baked inside, with a croissant, which was so fresh you could smell it across the table. Each item ran in the $12 - $13 range.

Also, thank goodness for the bottomless cup of coffee ($3.50), I must have drank four or five in the course of an hour! Service was great, the second I was empty the server refilled, water too.

Even after we ate I kept eyeing our neighbors'' dishes. I''d go back to try, um, everything."'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"This place was placed here to fulfill my brunchiest dreams! On my first visit to NYC, my dear friend brought me to Sarabeth''s because she''d heard good things about it, and boy did she hear right!

Upon walking into the venue, you''ll notice that the milieu carries a beach-side nostalgia and quiet ambient chatter. Loved it. The hostess and servers were perfectly friendly a we were seated and placed our order: Salmon Eggs Benedict and Almond Crusted French Toast. My friend requested iced tea to accompany her meal, while I had English Breakfast with milk and sugar for mine. What a prefect compliment!

When the food arrived, there were no regrets. The Salmon Eggs Benedict was AMAZING! Moist, savory, and served at the perfect temperature, I couldn''t ask for a better bite-sized party on my taste buds. Yes, it was THAT GOOD. As for the Almond Crusted French Toast, it was sweet and carried the perfect texture and delectable taste. Thank you, Sarabeth.

Life was good at this moment in NYC. :)"'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', 'Enjoyed a fantastic brunch with my boyfriend on a Sunday +  outdoor seating. Everything on the menu was so interestingly named. I ate there garden omelet (broccoli, red peppers, carrots, cheese)with a choice of bread. I chose a croissant.. although I should''ve tried there banana muffins instead. Feeling more hungry than ever that day, my bf and I ordered an extra plate from there sweet breakfast choice. We got apple cinnamon french toast with raisins and bananas. The waitress told us that customers usually get and love this dish. :) I dare not disagree!'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"I''v been here for brunch and dinner, and both were fabulous and decently priced.

The french toast is fluffy and not soggy at all - my two criteria for a good french toast.

Their french fries are perfection, and the desserts are out of this world."'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"I have a problem.  I love brunch.  Eggs, pancakes, french toast, crispy thick bacon, mimosas, coffee...any and all, and I am in.   I BRUNCH HARD!  
Met some ladies here on the UWS a few Sundays ago.  Got there around 10:45 and was seated by 11:15.  Service was good, food was excellent.  I will return."'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"I went here today (Columbus Day), so even though it was a Monday, it was relatively crowded, but I didn''t have to wait. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and almond-crusted french toast. I wasn''t blown away by the food, but also have nothing to complain about. I like the lemon ricotta pancakes better though--it was a perfect balance between sweet & lemon/tart :) The almond-crusted french toast was seriously just okay..a bit too much almond for me & a little dry for my taste. I don''t know if I particularly enjoyed the sauce (cranberry or strawberry) they drizzled on :/ 

If i go here next time, I''ll def. try their egg dishes before I decide if I would want to return here for breakfast/brunch again. Bottom line, it''s a place worth trying."'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"Ok, So I would do brunch in groups just to make everyone order a different dish so we could sample. Simply delicious.

Expect to wait in line on the weekends, but it''s well worth it. You may luck out and have a street fair near by to kill some time.

The Almond Encrusted French Toast is what ""portly dreams"" are made of! I cried once when I craved it on a Monday morning, they only serve it on weekends.

YUM."'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', 'Went with the parents. I didn''t think it was anything incredible and especially for the price. We got the Almond Encrusted French Toast, the Potato Waffles and the Lemon Ricotta ones too. They were all good, definitely, but worth the price? I don''t know...'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', 'Great experience. Sat outside for breakfast on a Monday morning. Not busy and service was prompt. Had the French toast and four flowers juice. Both were excellent. Great upper west side place'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', 'A great breakfast place in NY.  I havent been to too many brunch places in the city but this is one way to start and Sarabeth''s definitely set the bar high.  I went with a couple of my friends on Sunday morning and there was already a long line at ~ 1030am.  We had to wait ~ 30 min which is not bad at all.  I was hoping for some inspiration on what to order from fellow yelpers but still it was hard to choose cuz everything sound soo delicious.  I ended up ordering the potato waffle with chicken sausage.  I loved the potato waffle... very different and was something i couldn''t get anywhere else.  The chicken sausage tho... was a lil dry ... but still good.  Other great items included the almond french toast, and the popeye eggs =) Would love to go back and enjoy more of the preserves!!! I couldnt get enough of that!'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', 'Fabulous brunch!  Thin, light, ricotta lemon pancakes were memorable.  French toast was amazing.  Eggs benedict and omelets were perfectly executed.  Delicious assortment of scones/muffins in the bread basket - served with fab apricot and mixed-berry jams.  Although there was a long line, the wait was not bad at all.  Atmosphere was great and our hats are off to the servers for navigating around the line to refill drinks, clear the tables, etc.  Such a great experience that we went back the next day for more!'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"Based on Sam P''s review I decided to try this place for brunch.  I haven''t heard any of the hype (nor even heard of the place until Yelp), so I have no idea if this place lives up to it.  I can tell you that it totally rocks.

I went on a Saturday around noon and the wait was only 10 minutes.  The atmosphere is lovely.  Even though the place was full it didn''t feel crowded and gross.  We had a lovely time.

The food is also just as wonderful as the others say.  Really good, really different!  Anyone can whip up a pancake, but lemon ricotta?  Pumpkin waffles?  Almond-crusted French toast?  Yum!  Whoever puts together the menu is looking to give people a singular culinary experience. 

The prices are a little high for me (I''m poor!) but not so high that I can''t afford to go there every few weeks.  This is definitely a treat to look forward to."'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"Sarabeth''s is a good place for brunch, as long as you''re ok with waiting. I''ve been there for Sunday brunch early in the afternoon twice and had to wait about 30 minutes each time. I wasn''t in a rush so I was perfectly fine waiting. 

On my first visit I had the buttermilk pancakes and on the second visit I had the classic egg benedict and split the french toast with my friend. All three dishes were good, and that''s what you can expect at Sarabeth''s, consistently good food. It''s a bit overpriced for brunch, but it''s worth the splurge from time to time because it''s a nice atmosphere with good service and food that doesn''t disappoint."'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', '"I had my first Sarabeth''s experience on Saturday. I wanted somewhere I''ve never been before, fantastic sweet breakfast food (I gave up sweets for Lent.... oh the horror!), and a place where it''s worth it for a friend of mine to travel an hour to get to.

Luckily, we only had to wait 20 min and the weather was great. We sat down and perused the menu, I zeroed in on the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes or the Almond-Crusted French Toast. My Jersey (by way of Cali, he''d be offended if I didn''t mention that) Friend got the latter and we shared. I loved the pancakes, 4 rounds of soft fluffiness where the griddle was heated at just the right temperature to make it golden. I was moist and lemony, they weren''t too sweet. I just wanted to package them in my purse and save it... like Napoleon Dynamite w/ plastic wrap. As for the Almond-Crusted goodness, the slices were thick and dense with egg, which was perfect to hold the slight batter. It was crispy from both the batter and the almonds, drizzled with raspberry syrup.

In the end, he said it was worth the hour of travel to eat there."'),

I also enjoy a long afternoon tea hour (or two) here with my girl friends.  It''s too bad that we don''t live nearby, but when the weather is fair and we''re up for some strolling, we''ll make the trek to Sarabeth''s for yet another quintessential UWS brunch or tea."'),

Yes...it just costs too much...yes you could be waiting a LONG time if you don''t get your butt up at the crack of dawn or know someone who can get you in.  This is all true, but it''s the best sourdough you will find in the City (and I''m from San Francisco...I KNOW sourdough) and lovely omelets with fresh, yummy ingredients.  French toast is to die for....pumpkin waffles.  It''s high end but it''s good good good!'),

I had the french toast with strawberries and bananas and my friend had the spinach and goat cheese omelette. We both became members of the clean plate club! Still left feeling a little hungry though.'),
('BEYmqrP1_TC0nhnTGKkkJg', 'Sarabeth''s is a really charming place because it makes you feel like you are at home, very Martha-Stewart ish.  The wait for Sunday brunch was extremely  lovely.  We ordered pancakes, OJ, and almond toasted french toast with cherry cranberry sauce (delicious!!).  The prices are a little bit heavy, but I think the meal probably cost my friend about $30/35.  The only downer- the wait is insane and its a crowded place, but totally worth it.  I will be going back.');
