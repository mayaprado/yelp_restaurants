Bathrooms are very clean. Get there early it gets packed even on week days. Dimly lit, makes for a perfect date.'),
('a8CdwY4uFIP4nXkl4V5EEg', 'This place is very nondescript and if you didn''t have a GPS, you''d probably walk right past it. 
We came around 830pm on a Thursday night and there was a 45 minute wait to be seated in the booths. We opted for the standing area, which had some standing space and tall tables. It''s fairly dim inside and the menu is impossible to read unless you''re close to the bar. Drink menu here is fairly extensive with a mix of classic cocktails and their own creations. 
Place is excellent for a party of two. Great vibes here and not so loud that you have to shout.')
